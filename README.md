## User Story
* AS A developer
* I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
* SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a text editor web application
* WHEN I open my application in my editor
* THEN I should see a client-server folder structure
* WHEN I run `npm start` from the root directory
* THEN I find that my application should start up the back end and serve the client
* WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
* THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
* WHEN I run my webpack plugins
* THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
* WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
* THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
* WHEN I open the text editor
* THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
* WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
* THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
* WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
* THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB database
* WHEN I click on the Install button
* THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
* WHEN I load my web application
* THEN I should have a registered service worker using Workbox
* WHEN I register a service worker
* THEN I should have my static assets precached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
* WHEN I deploy to Heroku
* THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application

## Installation

* Clone the git repo from :octocat: [kea6t](https://github.com/kea6t)
* Then type npm init to install dependencies
* Then npm i express
* Then npm install and npm run build on client directory
* Then enter: "npm run dev" on root directory to launch the app 🚀
* Then open localhost:8080 to see app
